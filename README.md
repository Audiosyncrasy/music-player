# Music Player
The purpose of this project is to practice C# skills in bite-sized, easy to digest steps. In addition, I am also using Trello to keep track of the project status.

## Technology Stack
- WinForms application (.NET Framework 4.7.2)

## Features
Core functionality is based on the built-in Windows Media Player (WMP). The GUI has been removed, and the basic file selection and transport functionality has been assigned to the buttons at the bottom of the application window.

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Instead of having the Play button display an alert when the user clicks it, disable the button until a file has been selected.
- [ ] Disable Pause and Stop button when no file has been selected
